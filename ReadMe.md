### Synopsis
  
The EmAndLillist shop gives you the ability to re-sell used items that are still in good condition. This is a one-stop-shop for buying and selling anything and everything (legal!)...clothing, electronics, books, cars, and just about everything else you don't have use for anymore.

### How It Works
Create an account or login with Facebook to get started. Once you login, search for items you want to purchase, or post items of your own that you want to sell.

### Technologies
* Node.js
* Bcrypt
* Body-parser
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Morgan
* Passport

### Improvements

The ability for users to follow each other and get notified when people post items. Also allow for sharing items via social channels like Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, etc.
